# Medical-Data-extraction-
Project Overview:
This project involves developing a Python-based solution to extract and analyze medical data from images. Leveraging OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, and Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment, this project aims to automate the extraction of critical information from medical images.
Tools and Technologies:
Python: The primary programming language for scripting and data manipulation.
OpenCV: A library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
Tesseract OCR: An OCR engine for text extraction from images.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for developing, documenting, and presenting the project.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
Methodology:
Image Collection: Gather a diverse set of medical images for testing and development.
Preprocessing: Apply OpenCV functions to clean and prepare images for analysis.
Extraction Algorithms: Implement and fine-tune algorithms for text extraction and feature detection.
Testing and Validation: Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the extracted data with a set of validation images.
Documentation: Use Jupyter Notebook to document the code, methods, and results, providing insights into the analysis process.
